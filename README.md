# IR_RGB (NAVITAS DEVICEüì±)

The making of this project is only because I have several NAVITAS from my previous school orientation and also a random IR transmitterüö¶. 
NAVITAS is a device created by seniors which can be used in various kind of activities or games during the orientation camp ENITIO (NTU EEE‚ö°Ô∏è).

I don't have the original schematic of the device, so by using the continuity tester‚ú®, the basic connection (needed for this project) can be identified: 
1. DATA_PIN for the RGB strip is connected to Pin D5 
2. RECV_PIN for the IR receiver is connected to Pin D2

Since we cannot change the connection of the component on the device, there are several **modificationüéâ** I will suggest if you wanna recreate this project from scratch. 
1. Use Physical Interupt instead of normal if-else statement, the reason being the response of the product will be slower if using if-else statement.
2. Work on the colour palette, LOL, I am bad at colour palette, so I am quite sure you can design better colour flow LOL.

Anyway, this is just a mini project after my exam, not perfect, just a warmup for future projectüåü~
